# Screaming Swift Party Data analysis

## Data downloaded from RSPB records via the National Biodiversity Network (NBN) Gateway on 15-05-2025

### This project is intended to clean and analyse the data provided. Firstly by removing observations with less than 2 individuals recorded (screaming parties are defined as 2+ individuals flying at a low level, whilst, unsurprisingly given the name, screaming).

### Data was imported into MySQL workbench initially, before using MySQL connector for Python to allow further analysis and data visualisation.
